"1,10",1,I think most cases of sexual harassment through social media is not anything serious as you can block people. I think the only way there can be sexual harassment charges is if the reciever is under aged or they threaten to hurt someone.

"8,10",1,"I don't really think social media can strongly fight sexual harassment. Users can block harassers, and the website can suspend reported harassers; but that's about it. Anything further requires removing anonymity on social media so that their actions can be permanently linked with them, but that also risks exposing the personal information of victims."

"1,3",1,Not really much other than banning sexual harassment users and reporting to authorities if its severe
3,2,Stricter punishments for repeat offenders who use social media platforms to stalk/harass others
8,1," We must be careful in how sexual harassment is defined if we are to implement technology that, in effect, acts as the judge and jury over that person's ability to use the said platform. It is also worth noting that if any such algorithm(s) were to be effective, the definition of sexual harassment must be constrained considerably to reach the confidence intervals necessary to identify valid threats while minimizing the false positives resulting from unintended consequences of modeling a lot of otherwise common behavior that may happen to actually constitute harassment in certain contexts considering the sexual orientation of parties involved. Only the most flagrant of harassment would have a unique enough behavior profile to be segmented and eradicated effectively, and It should be. But the engineers of such software have an ethical responsibility to be very thoughtful in how these models are trained and come to be defined. And as an engineer you have a responsibility to portray the concrete and abstract complexity which such models entail. That's my 2 cents for what it's worth. "
