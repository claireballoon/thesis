\centerline{Classifying \#MeToo Hash-tagged Tweets by Semantics to Understand the Extent of Sexual Harassment}
\centerline{(Under the direction of Naeemul Hassan)}
\hfill \break

My thesis advisor Dr. Naeemul Hassan has collected approximately half a million tweets that contain the hashtag \#MeToo and completed an initial analysis regarding various aspects of this data. His work, as well as others', could be expanded if the tweets were categorized according to their semantics and if analyses could be performed on isolated sets of this data. This thesis contains a program that can process these tweets and categorize them by the type of sexual harassment expressed, if applicable. By using this tool to filter out extraneous tweets to isolate the ones that express a personal experience, researchers would be privy to more useful analysis of the data by working exclusively with tweets that express a personal experience with sexual harassment while knowing the type of harassment described.
