This chapter addresses the research and work conducted before the development process. It describes sexual harassment as it has developed and recognized both legally and psychologically as well as a discussion of the literature regarding sexual harassment categorization. This was fundamental to designing and applying a strong, comprehensive categorization topology to the dataset. This chapter also discusses the data used in the program, how it was collected, and how it was manually categorized for the supervised machine learning process.

\section{Legal History of Sexual Harassment in the United States}
Categorizing different types of sexual harassment is a task that remains incomplete despite steady, incremental progress. Researchers first began making significant contributions to the categorization of sexual harassment in the 1980's because "sexual harassment" wasn't legally recognized until the 1970's where it was initially established through case law. Initially, the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 made it illegal to discriminate employment opportunities based upon gender (and Title IX later upholding the same philosophies within education). Throughout the 1970's, several women used Title VII provisions to sue their employers for coercing (or attempting to coerce) them into sexual acts, and their successes within the courts enshrined sexual harassment as a criminal offense under these provisions. Since these cases, appropriately defining sexual harassment continues to be refined through improvements in research, laws, and court decisions today. As a controversial topic with many nuances and varied perspectives, proper categorization of sexual harassment necessitates a comprehensive legal understanding alongside a psychological one.

The first Supreme Court case ruling in favor of the victim alleging sexual harassment was in the 1974 case \textit{Barnes v. Train}, in which the harasser was found at fault for firing a female employee for refusing his sexual advances although the term "sexual harassment" was not used yet at this time. A few years later, the Supreme Court upheld that this type of behavior from employers was a violation of Title VII, and subsequently the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) refined the rules to explicitly cover this type of sexual harassment. Because of these changes, the plaintiff in the landmark case \textit{Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson} (1986) effectively established \textit{quid pro quo} behaviors as a form of sexual harassment as they were in violation of the EOCC rule changes. This case also recognized that comments of a \textit{quid pro quo} nature were in violation of Title VII even if the victim suffered no tangible consequences because they contributed to a "hostile work environment" ~\cite{bostonLawReview}. Now, sexual harassment continues to fall under the domain of the the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and Title VII, and the accepted definitions categorize sexual harassment as either being \textit{quid pro quo} acts or behaviors that contribute to a "hostile work environment." Through a myriad of rule changes, public statements, and Supreme Court decisions, the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights has upheld these same principles as they pertain to education.

What behaviors constitute sexual harassment as a criminal offense is continuously revisited through new court decisions. Under U.S. law, \textit{quid pro quo} sexual harassment, also referred to as sexual bribery, includes attempted and actual pursuits of a sexual nature against a person in a professional or academic environment when tangible benefits could be given or denied to the victim. Actions that contribute to a "hostile work environment" are the much more common category of sexual harassment. Lesser behaviors, such as offhand remarks, teasing or banter, and personal questions are not explicitly banned as acts of sexual harassment. However, if these acts occur with a sufficient degree of severity or frequency, they would then qualify as behaviors creating a "hostile work environment", thus qualifying as sexual harassment and by law must be evaluated comprehensively. When considering behaviors that do not take place in a professional setting, the actions cannot be evaluated under Title VII or Title IX regulations. These instances of sexual harassment that don't occur in a professional setting must occur with such a degree of frequency or severity that they can be considered (with context) as falling under harassment, stalking, cyberstalking, sexual assault, or other criminal laws. This technicality makes proper evaluation of sexual harassment complex because the behavior in question, while it might be considered sexual harassment in a professional setting, does not have an equal opportunity regulation to dictate it as such when the action occurs between peers.

\section{Literature Review}

As the courts first began to address more and more claims of alleged sexual harassment, the need for a proper categorization grew in order to appropriately assess the degree and severity of the actions. From both a legal and social research perspective, the lack of consistency among categorization definitions caused problems when trying to compare and use instances or research from one context as a guide when evaluating another. The first widely used standardization was designed by Frank J. Till in 1980. In his work, Till defines five major categories that consist of generalized sexist remarks or behavior, inappropriate and offensive but essentially sanction-free sexual advances, solicitation, coercion, and sexual crimes ~\cite{till}. This categorization was the most frequently used throughout the 1980's, although most organizations generally either rephrased the categories or consolidated them into three categories.

In 1992, James E. Gruber, a legal consultant, made a significant contribution to categorizing sexual harassment by defining three overarching categories and 3-4 subtypes for each one, for a total of 11 distinct, exhaustive, and mutually exclusive categories. The first category, "verbal requests", includes sexual bribery, sexual advances, relational advances, subtle pressures/advances. These are all behaviors that are said directly to the victim with the intent of a sexual or personal relationship goal. The second category, "verbal comments", includes personal remarks, subjective objectification, and sexual categorical remarks. These are statements of a nonsolicitory nature directed either to a woman (ex. teasing or jokes), about a woman, or about women in general. The third category of "nonverbal displays" includes sexual assault, sexual touching, sexual posturing, and possession/display of inappropriate sexual materials. Altogether, there are 11 distinct types of sexual harassment, and these categories are both mutually exclusive and reflective of the EEOC's guidelines ~\cite{gruber1992topology}. Gruber originally wrote these categories based upon reviews of sexual harassment that only included female victims and male harassers, but their continued application today shows that these definitions are not gender exclusive. These mutually exclusive categories establish a fluid progression in how certain behaviors can contribute to a hostile work environment, and Gruber's work continues to influence many more recent approaches to this topic. In a 2005 review of past, present, and future directions of improving gender and minority diversity in professional environments, Murrell and James refer to Gruber's work as a cornerstone in developing a comprehensive legal definition of sexual harassment ~\cite{murrell2002pastpresentfuture}. A study performed in 2005 to evaluate the effect of an obscene television show on individuals' perception of what constitutes sexual harassment used Gruber's categorization in their participant surveys in order to do so ~\cite{berlin2005gruberverification}. Despite the significance of his contribution, there is a neglected space of defining sexual harassment beyond the scope of Title VII and Title IX that Gruber's categories do not accommodate. Consequently, many researchers continue to consolidate these categories, and in doing so they claim a lesser degree of specificity to allow for the nuances of peer to peer harassment to be appropriately placed.

In order to accurately categorize a behavior as sexual harassment, a neutral, third party ought to be able to corroborate the victim's opinion through an objective analysis. The victim's perception is integral not just for legal categorization but also to understand the degree and severity of the harm inflicted on those who are exposed to the behavior; however, the victim might be biased and in some rare cases, dishonest. A study by Aparna Pathak on sexual harassment and coping behaviors synthesized many different research publications over the past few decades in her work. This synthesis notes that a 1997 study found that experiencing sexual harassment, whether or not the victim is aware of it, will still have negative outcomes on the victim ~\cite{schneider1997effects} in terms of health and distress. Furthermore, Pathak's review notes that (as of 2015, the time this was written) a study performed in 2000 is one of the only known, peer-reviewed attempt at documenting the extent of unwanted sexual attention from strangers. MacMillan et al. found that over 80\% of women experienced unwanted sexual attention (ex. catcalls) and just under 30\% of women experienced direct confrontation of a sexual nature from strangers ~\cite{macmillan2000street}. Altogether, this indicates that while Gruber's categorization might be the most appropriate tool for evaluating sexual harassment in a professional capacity because of it's adherence to EEOC guidelines, it does not necessarily scale towards including social environments outside of a workplace or school.

Shortly after Gruber published his categorization, Fitzgerald et al. developed a simpler, consolidated categorization architecture in order to consequently develop a better questionnaire for measuring sexual harassment. Their categorization was comprised of three types: unwanted sexual attention and gender harassment (hostile work environment) and sexual coercion (\textit{quid pro quo}). This categorization was an attempt to distinguish between sexual harassment "as a legal concept and a psychological construct" in order to better accommodate how a victim might perceive or label a behavior. Accommodating this "gray space" in victim perception allows for more consistency among responses, which guided their research goal of developing a more scalable questionnaire for surveying the frequency of sexual harassment ~\cite{fitzgerald1995measuring}. In a 2008 publication, Chamberlain et al. deviated from Gruber's 11 types for similar reasons. Upon the basis that these legal-driven approaches "underscore diversity" and "suggest substantial variation with regard to intent and severity" ~\cite{chamberlain2008newcategories} from the victims' perception. For their purposes, Chamberlain et al. uses the following sexual harassment categories: patronizing (sexist but nonsexual remarks, gestures, or condescension), taunting (sexual gestures, physical displays, and overly personal comments and queries), and predatory (encompassing sexual solicitation, sexual promises or threats, touching, and forced contact).

\section{Data}

A collection of 10,000 tweets were originally assembled into a single excel sheet with the tweet's unique ID and contents in two columns. The next three column headers contained the checks of relevancy, stance, and type of sexual harassment. If the correct classification could not be determined from the text available, the index was left blank.

To create a reliable training set of data, a sufficiently large amount of tweets were manually categorized by human readers. These voluntary participants were given a comprehensive explanation of sexual harassment both legally and psychologically, examples of properly categorized tweets, category definitions, as well as the categorization rules.

Participants were each provided 500 unlabeled tweets and asked to categorize them according to the rules provided. One male and one female of a similar age and level of education shared each set of 500 tweets and categorized them without having access to any other responses beyond the examples provided. Because research suggests that males and females assess sexual harassment differently, this process was performed to improve the integrity and consistency of the training set.

5,000 tweets were categorized total, with each set of 500 being categorized by a male and female. Cumulatively, 10,000 categorizations were made. Only the tweets that were categorized identically by both the male and female participant were considered in the training and testing sets of data.
